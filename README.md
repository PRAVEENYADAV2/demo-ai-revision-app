## ⭐ What Am I Building?

I want to **build an app that helps students revise topics from their books**, like **Duolingo**, but for **subjects beyond languages** – think Science, History, Math, and more!

### 🎯 Core Features
- 📄 **Upload Book PDFs** – Students can upload their own textbooks.
- 🧠 **Smart Chapter Detection** – Automatically extract **chapters, topics, and subtopics**.
- ❓ **Auto-Generate Questions** – Use extracted data to generate:
  - Fill in the blanks
  - Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)
- 🔁 **Gamified Learning** – Track progress, earn rewards, and compete with friends!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
