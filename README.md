⭐ What exactly do I want to accomplish? 1st step

✅ I want to create an app that helps the students to revise the topics present in book.
✅ It should be something like Duolingo but for Other subjects than the languages
✅ User should be able to upload the book pdf and the app should be able to determine the Chapters and Topics and Subtopics
✅ Use that metadata to get the content for the purpose of making fill in the blanks or Choose the correct option questions

⭐ How will a website help me reach my goals?


✅ User Access & Upload
The website allows students to upload their textbook PDFs, which is the first step in generating personalized content.

✅ Interactive Learning Interface
It can provide an intuitive and engaging user interface like Duolingo, tailored for subjects other than languages — such as Science, History, or Math.

✅ Smart Content Processing
Through backend integration, the site can analyze the book's structure (chapters, topics, subtopics) and organize the data into a knowledge graph or structured format.

✅ Automated Question Generation
Once the metadata is processed, the site can use it to generate fill-in-the-blanks, MCQs, and quizzes, helping students revise interactively.

✅ Progress Tracking & Gamification
The site can include progress tracking, leaderboards, and achievements, motivating students just like a learning game.

✅ Accessibility Anywhere
Being web-based makes the app platform-independent, accessible from any device — phones, tablets, or computers — without the need to install anything.

✅ Future Expansion
A website makes it easier to scale the product, integrate new features like login systems, adaptive learning, AI chatbots, and even mobile apps later.

✅ To-Do List: Learning App (Duolingo-style for Subjects)
📌 PHASE 1: Basic Website Setup

Choose tech stack (e.g., React + Node.js + MongoDB or Python Flask + HTML/CSS/JS)

Set up project structure (frontend + backend)

Create homepage layout

Add basic routing (Home, About, Features, Contact)

    Design logo & app name (branding)

📌 PHASE 2: Authentication & User Dashboard

User signup/login system (with JWT or session-based auth)

Create user dashboard after login

    Allow users to view past uploads & quiz history

📌 PHASE 3: PDF Upload & Book Analysis

Add file upload component (accept only PDFs)

Backend API to receive and store PDFs

Use a PDF parser (e.g., PyMuPDF or PDF.js) to extract text

    Use NLP (spaCy/NLTK) or regex to detect:

        Chapters

        Topics

        Subtopics

📌 PHASE 4: Metadata Extraction

Store extracted book structure in the database

Create a visual representation of chapters & topics (tree view or list)

    Let users select which chapters to generate quizzes from

📌 PHASE 5: Question Generation Engine

Use AI/NLP rules to:

    Generate fill-in-the-blank questions

    Generate MCQs

Ensure questions are grammatically correct

    Create question preview/edit option for users

📌 PHASE 6: Quiz & Practice System

Design quiz interface (timer, options, progress bar)

Add feedback system (correct/incorrect + explanation)

    Track scores and completion status per topic

📌 PHASE 7: Gamification & Progress

Add points, badges, and streak counters

Leaderboard (optional)

    Progress tracking per user, per subject

📌 PHASE 8: Final Touches

Mobile responsiveness

Dark/light mode toggle

Contact form / feedback page

Deploy website (Netlify, Vercel, or custom VPS)


































This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
